// src/poly/fattn.hpp - a prompt batch's attention with llama.cpp's flash-attention MMA kernel (fattn_mma.cuh, MIT)
// over a q8_0 or fp16 cache: heads of 256 values, 8 heads a group (Qwen3.6 / Cyber-Tiel's full-attention layers).
// The keys go in blocks: under q8_0 each block's K and V are dequantized to fp16 in the scratch, the kernel attends
// to them with the causal mask computed from the positions, and the blocks' results are merged by their softmax max
// and sum.  An fp16 cache is read where it lies, but for the last block (the batch's own rows), which is copied.
// Opt-in: STRATA_FATTN=1 (Qwen35::attn).
//
// Every call enqueues on the given CUDA stream.  Pointers are device pointers.
